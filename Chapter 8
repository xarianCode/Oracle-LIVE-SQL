-- will show usage of the WHERE clause and Comparisons too 

SELECT [EX_title], [EX1]
FROM [tablename]
WHERE [EX1] > 55 ;

-- This function helps find and modify the information display to only include those where "EX1" are Greater than 55

/* different symbols mean different things: 
        --  using a(n) = sign means you are looking for an exact match [55 = 55] is true 
        --  using a(n) > sign means you are looking for anything GREATER than said value [Example > 5]
        --  using a(n) < sign means you are looking for anythnig LESS THAN the said value [Exmaple < 5]
        --  using a(n) <>, != ir ^=  sign(s) means you are looking for anything NOT equal to [ 45 != 32 is a true statement]
        --  using a(n) <= sign means you are looking for anything less than or equal to [45 <= 45 is true, but so is 12 <= 45]
        --  using a(n) => sign means you are looking for anythnig GREATER than or equal to [45 >= 45 is true, but so is 100 >= 45]
*/

-- an example of this could be formed using the following information

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer# = 1010; 

-- this is looking wherever the customer number will be equal to 1010

-- Comparison operators work a little differently, usually searching for a range

/* examples are as listed:

    [NOT] BETWEEN x AND y    -- used to express a range, traditionally one found between the 2 values inserted
    [NOT] IN(x,y,...)        -- used to express a logical function, usually excluding
    [NOT] LIKE               -- used when you are looking for a pattern that DOES NOT contain the information in the field
    IS [NOT] NULL            -- used to find any information that does NOT have any information in that specific field, EX: missing dates, missing information, etc.
*/

-- the IN operator does the opposite of the "NOT" function

-- one example alluding to the table via Oracle SQL Live:

SELECT title,pubid
FROM books
WHERE pibid IN (1,2,5);    -- essentially saying "match Pubid wherever it is valued as 1 OR 2 OR 5"


-- LIKE operator can be used to find like-patterns, literlly

SELECT lastname
FROM customers
WHERE lastname LIKE 'P%';       -- This is saying "look through customers LAST NAME for anything with "p" in is, the % sign simply means "anything after"

-- for a quick intro to the %, using it on "p%" will bring up anything with P as a starting letter, however saing "per%" will ONLY find names starting with "per" and anything after.

SELECT order#, orderdate
FROM orders
WHERE orderdate BETWEEN '01-apr-09' AND '04-apr-09';      --this is looking for any dates between  April 1st and april 4th of 2009.

SELECT firstname, lastname
FROM customers
WHERE stat IN ('CA, TX');               --looking for customers from specifically California and Texas

SELECT firstname, lastname, state
FROM customers
WHERE state NOT IN ('Ca', 'Tx');        --looking for customers from Anywhere BUT california and texas


SELECT employee_id, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '%mar%';            -- this is looking for ANY employee name that has "mar" ANYWHERE in the name. In the example given in Oracle, "Omar" is the resulted employee for this search

SELECT customer$, lastname, firstname
FROM customers
WHERE customer# LIKE '10_9';             -- this numbre is looking for ANY NUMBER that is 4 digits, has 10 as the first 2 numbers AND has 9 as the last [Ex: 1029, 1019, 1039, 1049]

SELECT *
FROM books 
WHERE isbn LIKE '_4%0';                  -- this is a little more complex, but the same idea, looking for ANY number that starts with anything, has a 4 in the 2nd digits place, then ANYTHING in between BUT must end in 0

-- an example isbn for the previous "like" can be [2412312550, 14126230, 520104560] and EXCLUDES [5344299123, 12994950, 145968190, 188590100]

SELECT employee_id, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '_o_m%';            --like the previous, looks for any last name that has O as the second letter, M as the 4th and then anything after and in between [EX: Colmenares]





-- Time for Logical operators


-- usally composed of the values of "NOT", "AND", "OR"
-- This function requires ONE of these statements is at least true

SELECT title, pubid, category
FROM books
WHERE pubid = 3 AND category = "computer";          -- in this example, the AND function makes it to where the pubid MUST be 3 AND the category MUST be computer to be displayed, or else nothing is shown


SELECT * 
FROM books
WHERE category = 'FAMILY LIFE' 
    OR pubID = 4
    AND cost >15;

-- This example above looks for any instance of multipe info at the same time, however in an incorrect function, there is a "right way"

-- usually try to remember operators are determined bottom-up

SELECT *
FROM books 
WHERE (category = 'FAMILY LIFE' OR pubid = 4) 
    AND cost > 15;

-- This is a correct form of the previous example, now it looks for anything ABOVE 15 cost first, THEN looks for either "family life" categories OR any ID's where it is equal to 4



-- NULL values are typically the abscense of data, typically used in place of literally nothing, works better overall

SELECT order#, shipdate
FROM orders
WHERE shipdate IS NULL;  

-- this looks for wherever the shipping date has no actual value and displays it in the query

--
